          <h2>Inspiration & Creation</h2>
          <p>The short was inspired by cat video binge. Writer Rosana Sullivan admits to finding cat videos helpful during times of stress and says that while she had initially wished to “draw something that made her feel good, it evolved into something more” to her in the end. The action of Kitbull takes place in the Mission District, which is the first place Sullivan lived after moving to San Francisco, so it holds a special place in her heart.</p>
          <p>Though the 2D style of this short is different from what Pixar normally does, the personal touches make it feel very much like a Pixar product. Every frame is hand-drawn and hand-painted and the backgrounds were created by blending impressionistic, loose and fast painting with a bit of grunge and grit. Sullivan also says that the kitten’s nervous personality was made known in the short in the way she “uses a lot of the setting, like street signs and shadows, to stay invisible.” She highlighted the personal importance of this short and can’t wait for viewers to meet the little kitten.</p>
